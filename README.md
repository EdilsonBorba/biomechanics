Introduction

This script is designed for processing and analyzing marker and angle data from motion capture systems. It includes functions for filtering, processing, and analyzing kinematic data to extract gait events such as touchdown (TD) and take-off (TO) events.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, ipywidgets, openpyxl

Notes
Ensure the correct file paths are provided for marker and angle data.
Adjust filtering parameters (e.g., cutoff frequency, order) as needed for specific datasets.
Additional data processing or analysis steps can be added as per requirements.
